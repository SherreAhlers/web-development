            <label for='username'>Enter a Username:</label>
            <input type='text' placeholder='username' id='username'

<!-- action is important on form. Specifies where to send the data in the form.
    ex: action='/search/'    the form will take us to /search/resultofsearch     -->
<!-- What goes inside a form: 
        <input> *most important in form-
        <input type=''   types: 'text', 'password', 'color' (color will give a color picker), 'number'
        Name: in input will refer to value of input when data is sent to server  -- put name on every input you have.
        Placeholder: tells us what input is for 
        Labels: really important for making forms easier to use.
        label id='' needs to match the input you are labeling's for=''  
        Button: when have a button in form it will submit form when it is clicked... buttons outside of form will not do anything without JavaScript.  
        Button can have a type:  type='button' (this says I want it to act like a button instead of a submit inside a form only.)
        Radio buttons need a value=''  the value is what would be submitted to the server
        Select should have name='' and and id=''  then inside select you will have <option will have a value='' which is what is sent to the server.-->
<!-- <label for='pet-select'>Choose pet:</label>
        <select name='pet-select' id='pet-select'>
            <option value='dog'>Dog</option>
            <option value='cat'>Cat</option>
        </select> -->
<!-- input type='range' will give a range for the user to select-->
<!-- <input type="range" id='dog' min='1' max='10' step='5' value='5'
            name='dog-size'> -->
<!-- input <textarea> means the amount of area that the text can take up.-->
<!-- <label for="story">Tell us your story:</label>
        <textarea id='story' name='story' rows='5' cols='33'>It was a dark and
            stormy night...</textarea> -->
